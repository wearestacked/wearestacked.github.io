						<h3 class="font-bold mt40">Introduction</h3>
						
						<p>Our team always seeks challenges, so we decided to have hackathons and case studies every other month. The products created from our hackathons will be maintained and released as opensourced projects. </p> 

						<h3 class="font-bold mt40">The Challenge</h3>

						<p>Startups in EdTech category are coming out recently, this is a good reason to create a boilerplate for learning platform with all the basic modules and functionalities.</p>

						<p>The challenge is to create a learning platform in 2 working days.</p>
						
						<h3 class="font-bold mt40">The Solution</h3>

						<p>We will be using a PHP framework called Laravel and MySQL for the database. Laravel is the most popular framework today. We choose this tool for few reasons :</p>

						<ul>
							<li class="mb10">Laravel is popular among devs and anyone can clone this project and start immediately. Also any founder who want to use this boilerplate can hire any dev since laravel's documentation is so good and easy to follow and learn.</li>
							<li>All the technical issues are already answered by Laravel's big and active community. </li>
						</ul>

						<p>For this hackathon, we will be building a boilerplate app for learning platform that will be use by *instructors* to manage their courses/programs. Allow *student* to enroll to a program and earn certificates upon completion of the program. An admin dashboard to manage everything - programs, instructors, students, approve/reject a program, </p>

						<h3 class="font-bold mt40">What Went Wrong</h3>

						<p>We didn't have an ERD, our database was laid out in our minds and schema and relationships are setup immediately in Laravel models. We didn't have code documentations too. The problem came few weeks after this hackathon - we dig in a little deeper to refresh ourselves on how we made this platform. If we have the ERD and at least a basic documentation, we can immediately continue working on this project without digging deeper in the code.</p>

						<p>writing automated test will almost double the amount of time writing the code but it shouldn't be an excuse to skip it specially that this platform is decided to be released as opensourced project</p>

						<p>Due to time constraint, we used Laravel's templating feature to render html views. As a team who created API-based with angular/mobile frontend, creating app in a traditional way feels so wrong, displaying logic-heavy views is harder.</p>

						<p>To test our platform, we generated 1000s of users and programs, enrollments, progress, and reviews. The problem is we have small descrepancy on the generated data like - reviews was generated for future scheduled programs, it can be ignored but our data generator should be more accurate to produce realistic data</p>

						<p>SEO is completely ignored.</p>

						<p>Better naming conventions specially on the URLs, better project folders and files structures, </p>

						<h3 class="font-bold mt40">What Went Well</h3>

						<p>Enhanced team efficiency and teamwork</p>
						<p>We accomplished a lot and finished all the required functionalities in short period of time</p>

						<h3 class="font-bold mt40">Conclusion</h3>

						<p>We really have fun creating this project and it helps us improve our team</p>

						<p>Before we release this project as opensource we need to do code cleanup, refactor and optimization.</p>
						
						<p>We will also maintain this project and continue to add features like a other peyment options, other types of lesson, quiz module, option to group instructors and student (like university structure), reports and analytics, email reminders for schedule programs, automated test, and more</p>
